# Web4Factory Exploits

Here are two example exploits for Web4Factory. There were several other exploitable vulnerabilities in the service, but these are the two most interesting ones.

- [`type_confusion.py`](./type_confusion.py) - Exploits a type confusion bug in a [Java Native Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface) library. This actually involves using memory corruption on JVM objects and getting shellcode execution in the JVM!
- [`deserialize_spel_injection.py`](./deserialize_spel_injection.py) - Exploits [Spring Expression Language](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.x/reference/expressions.html) injection bugs
